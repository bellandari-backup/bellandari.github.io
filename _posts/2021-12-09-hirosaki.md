Also referred to as Takaoka Castle, it was built in 1611, then destroyed by lightning-induced fire, and finally rebuilt in 1804. This 3-story tower is one of only nine remaining structures on the property. Currently, the Japanese are repairing the foundation below the tower and have relocated it for the time being. They estimate project completion in 2021.
