After discovering the bruises on my back it was much harder to believe it was all just a dream. I now fully believed that there was something in my room with ill-intentions and I did not want to be there by myself.

Days went by, followed by weeks, and slowly but surely I felt like everything was returning back to normal. I was able to sleep properly, I didn’t have anymore ghostly visitors and everything seemed to be fine.

One day, on a day off, I was sitting at home on my laptop probably editing some photos I had taken while out and about (I took a lot of photos) and for whatever reason I needed something in my duty-bag. I don’t remember what it was but if I had to guess it was probably a pen or a notebook. I tore my duty bag apart before finding whatever I needed and instead of putting everything back where it belonged, I just put everything in a pile and put my Kevlar helmet on top.

That’ll hold it.

The photo above is to help visualize what’s about to happen.

The red circle is about where my bag was. At the time of the event, the green recliner and the nightstand to it’s left were swapped and I had a makeshift closet there.

The yellow circle, at the time of the event, was empty and the chair you see there now was originally over by the kitchenette, under the Assassin’s Creed flag hanging on the wall. This photo was taken a few weeks before I left Japan in 2013, for the sake of memories so things had changed between the time of the event and the photo. Anyway, continuing on.

After finding whatever it was I needed from my bag, placing everything into a pile crowned by my helmet, I went about the rest of my day doing whatever I did. The bag never moved, I never touched it, and the helmet stayed where it was with seemingly no difficulties. Can you guess where this is going?

In the middle of the night during a rather peaceful sleep, I’m startled awake by a loud bang near my head (yellow circle). I shoot up out of my bed and look around the dimly lit room but don’t see anything immediately. I get out of bed, turn on the lights, check all my corners and then look out the window looking for the source of the sound.

As I’m looking out the window (covered by those rather interesting yellow/blue curtains in the photo above), I notice something out of place in my room. At my feet (where the chair in the yellow circle is) is my Kevlar helmet. Nearly twelve feet from where I left it (red circle).

Now, for those who don’t know, a Kevlar helmet is not a light object. It’s not going to fall off of something with a slight breeze, let alone roll all the way across the room in a straight line with enough force to bang the wall by my head. Someone – or something – had to have thrown it.

The Lady in White wanted to make sure I didn’t forget about her.
