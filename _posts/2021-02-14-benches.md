Any ideas as to what could be happening? It appears to be two students, a boy and a girl, talking about something – and based off the boy’s posture – possibly something serious? Maybe something happened in the boy’s life and the girl decided to keep him company – the possibilities are quite endless.

It’s things like these that are always difficult for me to fathom. When you walk through a foreign country or an unfamiliar place and think about how amazing or cool or interesting that place may be, to someone that place is every day – and boring. To these two, this was just an every day stroll through a place they see every day and don’t think twice about. Everyone is the main character in their own stories. We sometimes play side characters, or background extras – but in most stories we don’t even exist.

When I initially took the photo – I saw the scene: the sidewalk, the tree hanging over the bench – and these two. I thought that might be a cool photo and that was it. I took the picture and moved on. Whenever I see it now, I stop and wonder what might have been happening or if these two have ever even seen this picture. For a brief, insignificant moment in time our paths crossed and we were background characters to each other.

I wonder if either of these two have ever seen this picture and not even realized it’s them.

Or maybe they did realize it and thought I was a creep.

Who knows.
