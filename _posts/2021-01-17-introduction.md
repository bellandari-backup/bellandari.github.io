That’s what it used to mean, at least. These days the word ‘Otaku’ tends to relate more towards being a geek or a nerd for anything of Japanese pop-culture – particularly anime.  It’s become less of an insult over the years and more of a title that some people will proudly wear. Whether or not I am one of those people who will proudly wear that title is a different story, however I believe that many people would refer to me as an Otaku in some capacity – perhaps as an Otaku-Lite (lol). 

Who am I? I’m an average nobody with an obsession for all things Japan. Growing up I slowly fell in love with Japanese culture (starting with my discovery of samurai around the age of 13). A few years later, closer to the age of 15 or 16, I met a friend who would change my life forever. He introduced me to anime (more than just the cartoons I saw on Toonami), introduced me to Japan itself, and showed me into the world of cars. Now, over a decade later I am still very much involved in those three things and have added a few additional hobbies to my life. 

At the age of 20 I was lucky enough to live in Japan for two years and I experienced a lot of amazing things that only deepened and furthered my love for it. I learned a lot about Japanese culture, their lifestyle and how they move about their daily lives.

At 22(ish) I moved back to the US and tried to integrate back into the American lifestyle. For the most part it was easy to return to what I knew initially – after all the way I lived while in Japan didn’t change much. However there was something noticeably different. Some of my mannerisms had changed – for instance I would often give a very slight bow when thanking or greeting someone. I had to quickly work this out of my habits as it often garnered strange looks from those around me. Driving on the left hand side was weeded out VERY quickly but perhaps the thing that stuck with me the most – even after nearly ten years of being back in the US – the feeling of not belonging.

Japan had a weird effect on me. For the two years I was there, even though I was thousands of miles away from my family, I felt at home. To this day I still get random bouts of “homesickness” and spend the day listening to and watching things I did during that time. I’ll pull up an old song or watch and old anime that I liked to entertain myself with back then. If that doesn’t do it I’ll tell my wife stories of my adventures there or end up on Google street view walking around places I’d been to before. One of my absolute FAVORITE remedies is watching Rambalac on YouTube and watch him (or her) navigate the streets of Japan with an ASMR quality of comfort.

For now, I guess that wraps up this about me. So what is this blog going to be about? At the moment it’ll probably be different rants regarding Anime as I’ve seen a lot of unwarranted hate towards specific characters in some of my favorite shows and my wife (although she enjoys anime as well) just doesn’t care to the degree I do (lol) so instead I’m going to write about them here and get that frustration out. Aside from those anime rants I’ll probably tell stories about my time in Japan and maybe share some photos.

We’ll see where it takes us.
