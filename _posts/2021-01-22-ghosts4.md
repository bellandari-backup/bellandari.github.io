This week’s story doesn’t involve me seeing another ghost or being attacked again – rather we’re going to talk about the aftermath of last week’s story.

Following my rude awakening from a seemingly invisible attacker I decided I didn’t want to stay in that room by myself any longer than I needed to. I threw on my uniform, grabbed all my gear and went to work a full three hours early. When I arrived I was naturally greeted by a bunch of curious looks as day shift wasn’t set to arrive for another few hours. The on-duty Flight Chief pulled me aside and asked me why I had shown up so early. I thought to myself for a minute about what I should tell him: a lie and hope he doesn’t press it or the truth and him think I’m crazy? I decided that telling the truth is never a bad idea, especially when there’s the possibility they might look at other reasons why I’m there early (am I drunk?), and tell him everything that happened.

I expected a few things. You’re crazy, you need to see a doctor, are you drunk? were all things I was expecting. Instead I was given “You need to see a priest” and “I’m giving you the day off, I’ll tell your boss”.

That, surprisingly, made me feel worse. I wanted it to be a dream. The idea that I was attacked by a paranormal thing like a ghost was a terrifying concept and this flight chief believed every word I told him. I was at a loss for words.

I asked if I could stick around the squadron until the sun came up as I didn’t want to spend any time in that room while it was dark and he agreed without a fuss. I sat in dispatch with the on-duty Desk Sergeant and joked about what had happened and talked about random nonsense until my own flight started to arrive. When the day shift flight chief arrived he was intercepted by the night shift flight chief and I was pulled aside to have a three way chat. I once again explained everything that happened and once again I was told “You need to see a priest, I’m fine with you taking today off”.

Bogus. The one time I wanted to work to keep my mind off things I was being given the day off. I mean, I understand it. You don’t want a Security Forces member out on the road when his head is a mess. They made the right call, but it drove me freaking nuts.

I told my friends about it, told my family, pretty much told anyone who would listen to me. A few hours later my mother texts me and says one of my aunts has a suggestion. At this point I’m about to call Ghostbusters so I’m all ears.

She suggests opening the bible to a particular verse, highlighting that verse, and leaving it open on my headboard (we had little shelves to place stuff). I’m Christian, born and raised but I’m by no means the most devout and I’m certainly not the best but I do believe. I’m absolutely willing to try. I go back to my room, find my bible, highlight the verse and place it on my headboard. I put a few little trinkets on it to keep the pages from blowing closed when I turn my fan on and for good measure, I place a set of Komainu, or Japanese Lion-Dogs, on either end of the headboard. The Japanese believe these two Komainu work together to both ward off and devour evil spirits – I figure some extra protection isn’t a bad idea.

Immediately the placebo affect kicks in and I start to feel much better. I’m able to joke about it with friends and try to debunk it little by little.

A few days go by and I’ve started to believe it was just a dream. A few of my friends echo the same opinion and it helps me feel like I’m not crazy.

I’m invited to go out exploring and I accept with enthusiasm. Some time away from the base should definitely help! I start changing and as I take off my shirt I catch a glimpse of my back in the mirror.

Fist sized bruises all across my shoulders.
