Alley ways are typically dark, cluttered, and depending on where you live – scary. However that’s not usually the case in Japan. Many alleys are filled with charming little hole-in-the-wall style restaurants and shops.

They also tend to hold one of the main aesthetics that some relate to Asian cities ; neon signs.

These neon signs, hung in the dozens, tend to create that “cyberpunk” style vibe and you can often find edits of that on Google with a quick search.

This photo was taken in the same area as the previous one, matter of fact I think it’s perpendicular. This one features a giant green banner of a prominent anime, manga, and video game shop – Kotobukiya.

Both of these spots are located in a small area known as Akihabara, located inside Chiyoda City, and is not a city in and of itself. It lends itself to the otaku culture and you can find many anime, video game, and nerd-culture stores in the area. Maid Cafes and arcades are also quite popular in this area and can be found without much trouble.

There is a little bit of history in the area, if you’re one for it. Long before Akihabara existed, the area originally served as a main thoroughfare due to it’s proximity to the city of Edo. As a result, many traders and craftsmen settled down on this route. In the mid 1800s, this area fell victim to a fire but was rebuilt in 1869. It received it’s name “Akibagahara” stemming from the name of a local fire-controlling diety, Akiba.

The area surrounding the shrine would later become known as Akihabara, a “holy place” for otaku.
