There’s not really a whole lot to this photo, strictly speaking – it just happens to be one I like.

In 2012 I flew back to the US to visit family and on the return flight I had a 24 hour layover in Tokyo. I was faced with the decision – do I leave the airport and wander around Tokyo for awhile or stay in the airport for the full 24 hours?

After a night in a capsule hotel, I woke up with about 14 hours to kill and decided to explore the airport itself. It was (if memory serves) about five stories tall with the very bottom level being the subway/train system and the following levels being a mixture of the airport and a mall.

The very top was a sky-deck where people could watch the planes come and go – such as the one above.

Knowing then what I know now, I would’ve gone exploring but eh.
