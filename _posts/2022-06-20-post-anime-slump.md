Recently, I finished yet another anime, as well as it's associated manga. I've started browsing the webcomic it originated from but haven't been able to find the complete source. 

Anyway. 

I started watching Horimiya on the morning of June 19, 2022 and finished the anime later that evening. I spent the following day pretty much doing nothing but reading the manga. 

As far as Horimiya goes, I really enjoyed the story. It was a pretty normal rom-com anime minus the toxic characters and over the top drama. Like most rom-coms (aside from Wotakoi, off the top of my head) it takes place during some high school student's third year as they finish their "youth" and prepare to enter the real world and adult life. 

I have no real complaints about the anime outside the fact that it's only thirteen episodes long. There's 128 chapters they could have used but instead of doing two seasons, they kept it to one and as far as I can tell there's no intention for season two, which is a bummer. 

The whole point of this post though isn't really to rant or rave about the anime, but more to discuss the post-anime slump that so many anime and manga enjoyers face at the end of a series. 

I don't know why it hits me so hard sometimes. I don't know if its because a lot of the shows that have this effect end with more of a heart-string-tug melancholy type nature or if I was just more invested in it than I thought. I deal with depression and anxiety as it is so I'm unsure if maybe there is some aspect of these shows that cause that to flare. 

As I'm pretty sure I've said in other posts, I'm pretty happy with my life. I have a beautiful wife who loves me for who I am and accepts me for who I am, who has been with me through many of my issues. I have a good, stable job that although I might not love, I can tolerate enough to stick around. My life up to this point has been good. 

But there are times when I wonder what my life would have been like if I had seen some of the shows I'd seen now. If they would have influenced the way my middle/high school days went. I wonder if that's one of the reasons why I feel some school aged kids these days are so different than those of my age were when I was growing up. They're exposed to these very mature themes and characters at such young ages that they seem to grow up so much faster. Watching some of these anime that I enjoy, there are characters you are supposedly only 14 or 15 years old acting like adults. 

All of that aside - I do whatever what things would have been like if I had done things differently, if my life had played out like a well-written script and not a hastily throw-together skit written on an caf√© napkin.
