While traveling in Japan, you’re pretty much guaranteed to happen across a shrine during your explorations. During one such exploration, my friends and I stumbled into this seemingly abandoned shrine. We had just finished our work day and decided to go for a short drive around the area instead of being cooped up in our dorms. While driving, we saw some swing-sets and being the giant kids we were, we decided to stop. We didn’t realize that immediately adjacent to the park was a shrine.

We decided to explore the area and see what this shrine looked like. After all, most of us hadn’t been to an actual Japanese shrine yet so this was a first! We had no idea it had fallen into disuse and disarray. During our short walk up the steps that nature had started to reclaim, we couldn’t help but feel that we were being watched – by someone, or something – from somewhere just beyond the tree line. As we circle the shrine, it became increasingly obvious that this shrine was no longer used – or at least was in the middle of being redone. It made the entire visit eerily haunting. With most of us having our own ghastly experiences with the paranormal, we decided it best not to stick around any longer than needed.

As of 2021, the red roof is visible on Google maps but I’m unsure if this shrine has been refurbished or returned to use.
