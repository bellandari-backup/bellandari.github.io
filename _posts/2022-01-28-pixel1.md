Many moons ago, there was a website called PixelCarLife. It was a forum-based role-playing game that revolved around illegal street racing. The premise was fairly simple - you get a "job", every week you collect money, and then you use that money to buy cars, modify those cars, and then race them against other players. Races were then judged by players specifically selected to judge these races. During my time at PCL, before it eventually died, I went through several positions of Judge and ended up at the highest tier, Blacklist Race Judge. In this position I judged, almost exclusively, high level races between players fighting for Blacklist positions. 

Now, keep in mind I was somewhere around 16 or 17 when I played this game so my knowledge of cars was different. Is any of what I say in any of these stories accurate? Maybe, maybe not.

**Part One - Again?**

“You’ve been assigned.”

It’s been awhile since I’ve seen one of these text messages. They always come from a blocked number and they always disappear after you close it. Lately, they’ve been arriving before the annoying black folders do so at least you’ve time to mentally prepare yourself for the task they volunteered you for. 

When I arrived at home, the black folder was waiting for me in it’s usual place on the entrance table right near the front door. I still haven’t figured out how they get in. The camera I placed on the inside always goes dead just before they arrive and comes back on once they leave. It’s quite an eerie feeling but after working with the Syndicate for so long I’ve grown used to it. Come to think of it, I think the only person to ever meet a member of the Syndicate is Jake, and he refuses to talk about it. 

I took the black folder out onto the balcony into my usual reviewing place. These folders always made my anxiety terrible so a cigarette while I review the materials always seems to help. Something like a distraction. With a quick light and a long breath, I opened the docket.

The folder contained all the usual documents. A note regarding the black card I was given the first time, a set of tickets for myself and my car, two driver profiles, two vehicle specification sheets, and a short brief on the location. All printed on high quality paper made in an unknown lab. 

A quick read over the documents at hand revealed another high profile race, this time in Sydney, Australia. Looks like I’ll be taking some vacation time from work again. The drivers in question are Jake and Flu, both high level racers who are well known in the underground. Jake has already claimed the first seat on the Blacklist, but Flu wasn’t going to let things slide. This race could change who sits at the top. The Blacklist was a tricky thing so I never knew for certain how these races would affect it. 

Jake’s profile read more or less the same as last time. He had a bit more experience under his belt and seemed to have moved away from the FWD vehicles. He elected to use a Shooting Brake version of an old Toyota Celica. The heart of the beast had been replaced with a monster LS1 V8. The build seemed to revolve more around control than power, as the engine had only a few light modifications but the suspension seemed to be dialed in. 

Flu’s profile was new to me. The reports included in the document suggested he was quite the driver, able to quickly adapt to changing conditions and read opponents while racing against them. Two very important traits when driving against anybody, really. He was also known for being able to visualize his line ahead of time and dive into those corners with vigor. His car was a Skyline R34 tuned to a subtle JDM perfection. Godzilla seemed to be well balanced and could prove to be a tricky match for Jake’s Celica. 

The map of the proposed circuit was a doozy. It’d start near the Hudson Ballroom and go North across the bridge, through what seemed to be a residential district before briefly joining the M1. After a short high speed burst, the drivers would be launched back into a residential district before eventually returning to the industrial district, passing a fish market before ending near the Hudson Ballroom. This course would give both vehicles a thorough workout. Usually just by looking at the course I can sort of predict who has the advantage, but this time I was genuinely clueless. 

Why does the Syndicate always do this to me?

**Part Two - That’s great, just…great.**  

After about a week of preparation, reviewing, packing, and waiting, the time finally came for me to head off to the land down under. According to the docket the Syndicate provided me, Jake and Flu should already be there familiarizing themselves with the course.

I met with Tom at the airport where we exchanged some brief pleasantries and loaded the Elise into the cargo hold. The aircraft didn’t surprise me anymore but the mystery of it always creeped into my head. Knowing the Syndicate this aircraft probably doesn’t actually exist anymore, or perhaps it never did. The interior was the same as last time, all white and pristine like it was freshly built. I put my bags inside the little room, strapped myself into the seat, popped a dramamine, and promptly passed out.  

A few hops and several long restless sleeps later, we arrived in Sydney where Tom and his crew said their farewells for the day. The arrangements had been made for a hotel and Tom would be waiting for me after the race was over. Not long after I unloaded my car and my bags, the plane was immediately hauled away into a small hangar hidden at the back of the airport. I should have figured as much. 

I drove the car off the loading ramp and onto the main road. The task at hand was apparent. Jake and Flu had been driving the course, learning it’s turns, straights and hidden secrets while I’ve been drugged up and passed out. I needed to get on the course and see it for myself. If I was going to keep up with them, knowing where I’m going is vital. 

Several short hours and a greasy hamburger later, I had a general understanding of the course. The busiest part of the course would be navigating the nightlife in Sydney. The residential areas shouldn’t present too much of a problem, at 0200 nobody should be hanging out in the residential areas anyway.  

The only real problem I can see is the presence of law enforcement patrolling the area in the downtown part of the course. That’s not to mention the starting point is within a stones throw of one of the precincts. If we attracted the attention of the law, there were six different bridges they could cut us off at. It’s unlikely a race like this would be hard to keep under wraps given the prestige the blacklist holds. I can’t imagine three high powered cars thundering through downtown and the residential areas would go unnoticed. 

**Part Three - Not a matter of if, just when.** 

The Hudson Ballroom was still busy at 0140. The drunken shenanigans of the well-to-do never fails to amuse me. By this time, the two drivers should be waiting for me by the bay, overlooking the beautiful city. As I walked out the Ballroom’s front doors, I lit up the cigarette between my lips and took a deep breath. I passed a few other smokers, a drunk keeled over the garbage heaving the contents of his stomach, and a couple of shady characters engaging in who knows what. Doesn’t concern me. 

Just past these folks was the main road, and on the other side of that was a small parking lot connected to a viewing area, for those of us hopeless romantics who enjoy dreaming while overlooking a darkened city. Jake and Flu were waiting where I thought they’d be, Flu sitting on the bench facing the bay and Jake leaning against the guardrail facing him. 

Whatever they were talking about came to a stop when I arrived. I pulled the smokes out of my coat and offered one to each, and only Jake accepted. Flu made a comment about cancer sticks to which Jake and I just laughed. 

Smoke filled the air. 

“Alright, fellas. I’m sure you’re excited but this race is going to be a bit harder than you expect.”

“How so?” Flu asked, not sure what I meant.

I pointed behind me, towards the city. 

“Just past the ballroom is a police precinct. Just past them is the Australian Federal Police. Downtown has officers all over, especially on a night like this when the drunks are plenty. Considering the volume of law enforcement in the area you’ll have to be careful. If you get noticed and the police decide they want you, it won’t take much to stop you when you get to the bridges.”

This comment didn’t sit well with either driver. Flu leaned back, stretching his arms over his head and letting out a deep breath. Jake took a long inhale and slowly let the smoke escape his lungs. I continued. 

“If the fuzz doesn’t notice you before you get across the bridge, you’ll be in the residential areas. There’s a lot of neighborhoods here but they shouldn’t present much of an issue. This late at night I’d imagine anyone who is still awake is probably where we are. With your cars, there is the possibility of people calling us into the local LEOs. If they do, it could present a problem at the next bridge.”

“You mean a roadblock.” Jake chimed in. 

“Correct. Like I said, if they want you bad enough they might be willing to do something like that. Just remember they may also give chase. There are quite a few Holden squad cars in the area and these officers know the roads better than you do.”

Flu stood up and moved towards the guardrail to stand next to Jake. I could tell his mind was moving at a million miles an hour. 

“Something on your mind, Flu?” Jake asked. 

“I’m just thinking. Mugenjou, what do you think the probability is that the police will get involved?”

“Honestly? I’m about 60%. If the police don’t get involved, we’ll be lucky, but considering how busy the bars are they could be preoccupied. The course itself shouldn’t be an issue for either of you, both of you are great drivers and your cars are built with care. The local populace is what you’ll have to worry about. The nightlife in the local area by the bars and the bay will be your main concern until you see your first set of blues.”

“If we see our first set of blues.” Jake made sure to point out the “if” factor. 

**Part Four - Interference**

Jake and Flu lined up at the light, just outside the ballroom. Two long honks and a short one later both vehicles and I were off the line and thundering through the first turn. Jake filed in behind Flu, the AWD system of the R34 giving Flu the immediate advantage as Jake very briefly spun his wheels. The Celica regained traction and the V8 kept the distance to a minimum. By the end of the straight, Jake was on Flu’s bumper. 

The first bridge came up sooner than I had expected, Jake and Flu easily sitting about five seconds in front of me. I had to sit back far enough to watch for complications but close enough to monitor the drivers. The nagging feeling of being watched pierced the nerves in my back. 

We shot off the bridge, the cars dipping as our suspension took the slight height difference between the bridge and the tarmac. The M1 loomed overhead as the road brought us under the structure for a brief moment before throwing us back into moonlight by Greenwood Hotel. 

This section of the race would be the longest as we navigated through the quiet neighborhoods and numerous bridges. Flu still controlled the lead, but not easily. Jake’s LS1 powered shooting brake kept the pressure on the Skyline. Then…disaster. 

We had just passed the Greenwood Hotel when the road lit up to blue lights bouncing off the walls. An officer must have been posted near the building monitoring the drunks exiting the premises when we caught his attention. There were now four of us flying through the still streets, the blinding blues taking my rearview mirror from me. 

We passed St Leonards, the gentle double bend in the road providing a brief second of relaxation before the law came back into view behind us. The two drivers in front of me seemed unfazed by our new addition. Up ahead were a few cross streets where an officer must have been hanging out. The officer shot out of the side roads and into the intersection. Flu pulled left and the push bar of the squad scraped the paint down the side of the Skyline. Jake ducked to the right at the last second, his driver mirror knocking the law’s left tail light out before bouncing off the road and careening over my head. The drivers quickly recovered from the brief encounter and took off down the road again.  

I was still waiting for someone to make a move. Both drivers were feeling each other out and by now something needed to happen. The corners here were easy and none complex enough to require any advanced techniques which put Jake at a disadvantage. His rally-esque skill set he had mastered served little use on a course like this, but he had power on his side. The opposite was true for Flu. Flu’s expertise was in reading opponents, adapting to circumstances, and powering through racing lines with extreme accuracy, and despite his car’s power, his skill was showing.  

By now we had just passed the M2 at the northernmost part of the course. Flu was still controlling the lead, Jake was still a close second, and I still followed. The police hadn’t given up either and by now we had about three units in total behind us. With our previous encounter it was likely they might get more aggressive. My biggest worries were spike strips and roadblocks, anything else we could handle. 

The course changed our direction, now taking us south and the first bridge on our return to the Hudson Ballroom was coming into view. Jake tapped on Flu’s bumper, the power under the hood begging to be released. Flu had a knee jerk reaction and pulled to the right, Jake capitalized on Flu’s mistake and put his foot down, the sudden propulsion from the draft aiding him in taking the lead. 

Flu regained his composure and pulled in behind the Celica. The second and third bridges went by without issue and the police were slowly falling back, unable to keep up with the tuned street machines on the currently empty roads. This meant one of two things: they’d either call off the pursuit in the interest of public safety or they’d call in a helicopter to monitor us. 

We were about to cross the fourth and final bridge when traffic began to build on the roads ahead leading into downtown. Jake tapped his brakes when a car unexpectedly cut him off and Flu seized the chance at the lead. They were now neck and neck as they weaved through the unsuspecting motorists on the narrow road. One of the officers had caught up and was now putting pressure on all three of us. 

Up ahead, there was a sharp left hander that would take us to the final section. Neither driver let up any space and both took it at full chat. The difference in their styles flourished as Flu went wide following a racing line. Jake, on the other hand, used his rally pedigree and took the corner at an angle. It seemed he intended to keep his momentum through the corner and clip the wide apex but the Celica slid a bit further than he anticipated. Flu ’s timing was nearly perfect, he zipped through the slight gap that this created as Jake went slightly wide.

The police lost a few seconds on us here as they slowed down to watch for any traffic navigating the corner before accelerating to catch us again. In the distance I could see the fish market. With only one bend left before the ballroom, this is where it would matter most. Would Flu be able to predict Jake’s movements? Would Jake’s more powerful car make up for the difference in styles? Would the police be waiting on the other side?

I put my foot down and reigned them in placing their cars within two seconds of me. Jake was on the inside corner, opposite Flu. They both appeared to be level with each other, but the power of Jake’s car showed as he started to inch on Flu in a last ditch effort to pull ahead. 

It didn’t work. He hit his brakes to adjust to the corner, remembering the last time he took one with rally style. Flu closed into the corner brushing past, narrowly missing Jake’s right headlight. Flu was now in front with a second or two to spare. 

Seconds later, I hit my brights as a signal the race was over. We had set up a fallback point beforehand and agreed to meet there if the police showed up. Both drivers took their own routes to the agreed location and the remaining officer fell back to regroup with his fellow members. 

An hour away was a small underground garage with no one in it. Well, except the two drivers. Both were inspecting their damages and talking to each other about who knows what. Once again, when I arrived they stopped chatting and waited for me. 

“Alright fellas, time for a debrief.”

**De-brief**

So more or less, this race came down to perks. 

Jake: Your perks didn’t do you much good on this course. With the highways and the corners presented none of them were complex enough for Apex to be of value, and this put you at a disadvantage. Considering your remaining perks, you’re definitely more Touge/Rally oriented. There were a couple spots that I used on this course, but when put against Flu, they didn’t triumph.

Your vehicle was also pretty solid, and seemed to be built well. However, I didn’t feel like the vehicle alone with the nearly forty extra horsepower could make up for the lack of applicable traits. Nice layout, by the way. 

Flu: Your perks were more or less spot on for this type of course. The length of the course gave you the time required to understand Jake’s style, and your remaining perks gave you the advantage in reading the race as it evolved, the lines that were created, and then hitting those lines with accuracy. 

Your car was less powerful (speaking of which, why?) so your perks definitely filled the gap where your power wasn’t. That also brings me to another issue with your vehicle. There’s no actual HP of the vehicle listed in your profile, so I’d fix that before you race again. The Maps shouldn’t be your primary HP listing, so consider this is your warning from me. Also, be aware that your spec-sheet is a bit confusing (colors/layout), so I had to go through it three or four times as a result.

**Summary**

All in all, it was a good race. I always hate judging these close ones because it really could go either way. Flu takes the win this time. I apologize for the lackluster story as I realized some errors in my decision to get the police involved and hit a creative wall towards the end. 

There will be a 24 Hour grace period from the time this is posted (01262017/XXXX) to contest or challenge any results, gains, or damages.
