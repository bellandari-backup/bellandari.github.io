Among all the characters, both good and evil in the Naruto series, for some reason Haruno Sakura is among the most hated – if not the most hated character and to be honest, I don’t think that’s fair. Before we get started, just a warning – this is a long one as I bring up a few examples. There are also spoilers involved so if for whatever reason you haven’t watched the series but are interested in this break-down, just be advised. Also – disclaimer – this is all obviously just my opinion. There are nearly 1000 episodes and nearly a dozen movies so there is a lot of information that is both cannon and filler. If you want the “TL;DR” version, it’s at the bottom.

**Who is Haruno Sakura?**
She’s an important main character in the Naruto series and a member of Team 7 (initially under the leadership of Hatake Kakashi) with Uzumaki Naruto and Uchiha Sasuke. The entire story revolves around the relationship of these three young shinobi. The short of it is –  Naruto loves Sakura, but hates Sasuke. Sakura loves Sasuke, but hates Naruto. And Sasuke is indifferent to both of them, focused merely on his goal of revenge.

**Why is Sakura hated?**

I’m not entirely sure but here’s what I can figure out, based on some comments I see on VRV, YouTube, and Instagram. The general argument is that she is a useless character who always needs saving and can never do anything for herself. She’s lied to Naruto, tried to use Naruto and the focus of her love (Sasuke) has tried to kill her multiple times but for some reason she still loves Sasuke. I’m sure there’s some more but that seems to be the general train of thought that I can find.

**Why do I defend Sakura’s character?**

There’s a few reasons why I defend Sakura’s character and why she deserves a spot in my personal Top 5 Naruto Characters. The biggest, and probably most important reason, is that above all else she is simply human. She isn’t perfect, she makes a lot of mistakes and occasionally has bad judgment. She doesn’t possess that main character ability of always doing the right thing.

One of the biggest arguments I see is that Sakura is “useless” and that not even the writer of Naruto likes her much (I don’t know if that’s true, but regardless, still no reason to hate her). I’m not really sure where this useless quality comes into play. Compared to her team-mates, Uzumaki Naruto and Uchiha Sasuke – she does seem to pale in comparison.

Naruto possesses a tailed-beast and Sage abilities, becomes a student of one of the legendary three shinobi, Jiraiya, and at one point had Sage of the Six Paths abilities. Sasuke possesses the Sharingan, the Rinnegan, becomes a student of one of the legendary three shinobi, Orochimaru, and at one point also had Sage of the Six Paths abilities, effectively making Naruto and Sasuke god-reincarnates at one point in the series. Sakura has…one of those. Comparing most people to Naruto or Sasuke would make even some of the most capable people look useless.

As I stated previously, Sakura is very much your normal girl. Her parents were also shinobi but did not garner fame or crazy abilities. Her family does not possess any special bloodlines like the Uchiha’s Sharingan or the Hyuga’s Byakugan. Through and through, Sakura is completely “normal”. At the very beginning this immediately paints her in a bad light. She immediately useless because she had a normal upbringing – she didn’t lose both her parents as a baby and become an outcast, nor was her family murdered leaving her as the sole survivor. Her upbringing was unremarkable.

**So what does Sakura have?**

Towards the end of the first series, Sakura becomes a student of the current Hokage, Tsunade – one of three legendary Konoha shinobi (now all three legendary shinobi have students). Under Tsunade’s tutelage, Sakura learns medical ninjutsu and undergoes Tsunade’s strength training.

As a result she becomes an incredibly capable medical-ninja credited with saving many lives both on and off the battlefield. She also has incredible strength and is routinely seen destroying the landscape around her with a single punch – even making someone as powerful as Naruto fear her.

Finally, she learns the Strength of a Hundred Seal – spending three years storing energy in a pinpoint spot on her forehead, a feat Tsunade’s direct aid Shizune wasn’t able to complete. When this technique is released, it amplifies her medical and physical strengths allowing her to take near fatal blows with little consequence for a limited time.

However, despite all this – she is still hated. She doesn’t become a god-reincarnate. She was never a child-prodigy. She lied to the main character (gasp) and had to be saved by the main character several times. Let’s look at the main two incidents people like to bring up.

**#1: Her “confession” to Naruto**

About midway through the Shippuden series, there is a scene where Sakura confesses her love for Naruto. Naruto immediately sees through the charade and calls her out on her lie, saying he hates people who lie to themselves. Why is this important?

Remember at the beginning of the original series when Sasuke originally leaves? Naruto makes a promise to Sakura that he’ll bring Sasuke back and that he never goes back on his word. In Naruto’s mind this means that no matter how many times he fails, he’ll continue to try to find Sasuke until he’s successful.

Back to the present, Sakura has seen the damage Sasuke can do now that he’s become a full-blown rouge and criminal, and she’s seen how much Naruto obsesses at trying to find Sasuke – at points putting himself in extreme danger. Sakura believes that if she can convince Naruto (and herself) that she no longer loves Sasuke, perhaps Naruto and Sasuke won’t kill each other in the process and Naruto can return to a somewhat normal life. Sakura believes Naruto is doing all this for her sake and when he turns her down she realizes that it’s not for her sake, but for his own.

I feel this is an important event to discuss. Was giving a false confession to Naruto wrong? Absolutely. Even if Naruto hadn’t seen through it, it would’ve been nothing but pain as she tried to convince herself otherwise. Was it necessary? I’d say yes. It was this event that made her realized that Naruto had more or less given up on becoming something with Sakura, and that no matter how much she lied to herself she still loved Sasuke. It is a very HUMAN moment for Sakura.

**#2: Pleading for Naruto to save Konoha during Pain’s attack**

This one kind of makes me laugh. During Pain’s attack, Sakura is seen at one point on her knees screaming for Naruto to come rescue the village, and poof – Naruto appears to save the day. People like to use this as an argument for her uselessness seemingly forgetting two facts: she’s a medical-ninja, and she’s not a hero.

Tsunade drills into her from day one that the most important thing for a medical-ninja to do is stay alive. Running in to fight attacking Akatsuki is a surefire way to get herself killed and result in the deaths of any of those she could have saved with her medical abilities. The smartest thing for her to do is stay away from direct combat and heal the wounded.

The second point is – she’s not a hero. As I’ve stated before – she has no real special abilities. She possesses no special eyes or tailed beasts and family secrets. All she has is her medical abilities and her high-physical strength. Against an enemy like pain, anything short of Naruto or Sasuke’s ability would be useless – and this is shown with Kakashi, Tsunade, and many other ninja regarded as being “more powerful” (including Naruto’s teacher) than Naruto are killed or tossed around with ease by Pain. It is only natural for her to despair waiting for the one who left the village to train specifically for this moment.

**If people don’t like Sakura, who do they like?**

Hyuga Hinata – Naruto’s future wife and mother of their two children. Now, don’t get me wrong – I love Hinata. She’s a great character with a lot of great moments and great development. However people don’t label her as useless for some reason. Between Sakura and Hinata, I would say Hinata is less useful than Sakura, and much like everyone does with Sakura, I have two incidents that come to mind.

The first being when Hinata tries to rescue Naruto from Pain. She very briefly fights with Pain while attempting to free Naruto from his binds and although this is a key moment for her character the only thing she is able to contribute is her death. Watching Pain kill Hinata throws Naruto into a fit of rage that allows the Kyubi to take over. Eventually, once the conflict is resolved, Hinata is revived and life goes on.

The second being when Hinata talks Naruto out of his despair during the Fourth Great War after Neji’s death. Naruto, feeling responsible for Neji’s death is on the brink of self-destructing when Hinata clasps his face in her hands and speaks to him. She talks him out and gives him the encouragement and pep talk needed to get back in the fight.

And that’s it. Those are really the only two sections in the story (off the top of my head) where Hinata actually did something, and both of them had nothing to do with her combat abilities. During the Fourth Shinobi War, Hinata had a pretty small role in it compared to the “useless” Sakura who revived and kept Naruto alive at key points (literally pumping his heart for him at one point) as well as stood side by side with Naruto and Sasuke fighting the Ten Tails earning respect from both Sasuke and Naruto (granted it was only for a very short period of time before they attained Sage of the Six Paths).

**Summary**

All in all, I feel the hate Sakura gets is extremely unjustified and lopsided. I think some people like to hate Sakura because she’s a character that is easy to hate and the mob mentality of hating her becomes something people like to join in on. Understand her character, where she comes from, who she is and her motivations and you see that she’s far from useless.

**TL;DR Version:**

Compare Sakura to Naruto and Sasuke and of course she looks useless. Compare just about anyone to those two and they’ll look useless. She poses no special abilities or family bloodlines but she still becomes a key player in the Fourth War and is able to stand side by side with her teammates afterwards.
